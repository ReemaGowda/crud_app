JSON Server as the Backend for Data retrieval.

JSON Server simplifies all of this. Just npm install -g json-server and you get a readymade Database and a HTTP Server . This package uses a single file db.json (or any other JSON file), treats the file as a JSON database and also exposes routes on which you canGET, POST, PUT, DELETE for that db.json file.

To start your service, all you have to do is open your terminal and run json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
